# Spillover Effects of Mass Shootings

We study the effects of mass shootings on tangential "shooting" related economies, in particular counter strike.

The main question being "**does demand for shooting activities increase after a mass shooting**?" 

To analyze this question,  we use interactive maps to show the basic pattern of Mass Shooting severity and the Counter Strike popularity  in each state. Then we use some linear regressions to investigate the relationship. Finally we conduct dynamic DID and conclude that relatively “small” Mass Shootings increase the CS popularity while relatively “large” Mass Shootings reduce the CS popularity.
